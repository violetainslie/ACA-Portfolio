                This final reflection should be written as a narrative, <i><u>not</u></i> simply as a bulleted list. Use
                the questions on the following page to guide your reflection. You do <i>not have to address all of the
                    questions</i> in your reflection, but focus on the questions that you can most meaningfully address.
                A good rule to consider as you draft your reflection is "What, So What, Now What?" First, <i>what did
                    you learn;</i> secondly <i>why is it important</i>, and third, <i>what does it mean for you now that
                    you know it &mdash; what will you do with that knowledge?</i><br>
                Questions to consider for the Reflection element of the Portfolio:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How has your approach to college and being a student changed during this class? In what ways have
                    your attitudes
                    about learning, studying, time management, wellness, and/or finances changed?</li>
                <li>What has been your one biggest, most significant “take-away” from ACA 122 this semester? Why was
                    that one thing
                    so particularly meaningful for you, and how did you (or will you) apply it in your life?</li>
                <li>What did you learn about yourself in ACA 122?</li>
                <li>Did taking this class confirm any decisions you had previously made about your academic or career
                    goals? In what
                    ways?</li>
                <li>Did taking this class change any decisions you had previously made about your academic or career
                    goals? In what
                    ways?</li>
                <li>Which campus resource that you learned about this semester has been the most valuable for you?</li>
                <li>Which campus resource that you learned about this semester do you plan to utilize in the future?
                </li>
                <li>What would you do differently if you had a fresh start to the semester, knowing now what you perhaps
                    did not
                    know when the semester first began? How will you apply that knowledge to make next semester
                    different?</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Reflection:</h1>
            <p>I wish I had asked for help sooner. ACA 122 provided me with information about Durham Tech's resorces,
                and yet still I was too stubborn to ask for help. I am now 8 weeks into my math course and am failing.
                If I had taken the advice from this class more seriously, I probably would've sought out these resources
                sooner and been better off. Instead, I am now struggling to get my grade up. ACA 122 taught me to be
                less stubborn &mdash; to understand that just because something is foreign, doesn't mean its wrong. I've
                always been good at school. I've made my way through all of my classes, overperforming, with minimal
                effort. But college is different, I actually struggle in my classes; ACA has taught me to <i>do</i>
                things about my problems instead of just <i>sitting</i> with them. </p>
