                This final reflection should be written as a narrative, <i><u>not</u></i> simply as a bulleted list. Use
                the questions on the following page to guide your reflection. You do <i>not have to address all of the
                    questions</i> in your reflection, but focus on the questions that you can most meaningfully address.
                A good rule to consider as you draft your reflection is "What, So What, Now What?" First, <i>what did
                    you learn;</i> secondly <i>why is it important</i>, and third, <i>what does it mean for you now that
                    you know it &mdash; what will you do with that knowledge?</i><br>
                Questions to consider for the Reflection element of the Portfolio:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How has your approach to college and being a student changed during this class? In what ways have
                    your attitudes
                    about learning, studying, time management, wellness, and/or finances changed?</li>
                <li>What has been your one biggest, most significant “take-away” from ACA 122 this semester? Why was
                    that one thing
                    so particularly meaningful for you, and how did you (or will you) apply it in your life?</li>
                <li>What did you learn about yourself in ACA 122?</li>
                <li>Did taking this class confirm any decisions you had previously made about your academic or career
                    goals? In what
                    ways?</li>
                <li>Did taking this class change any decisions you had previously made about your academic or career
                    goals? In what
                    ways?</li>
                <li>Which campus resource that you learned about this semester has been the most valuable for you?</li>
                <li>Which campus resource that you learned about this semester do you plan to utilize in the future?
                </li>
                <li>What would you do differently if you had a fresh start to the semester, knowing now what you perhaps
                    did not
                    know when the semester first began? How will you apply that knowledge to make next semester
                    different?</li>
            </ul>
