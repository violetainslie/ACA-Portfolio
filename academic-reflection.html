            <p>
                Now that you've completed several reflections and research assignments (HW3, HW4, HW5), take a moment to
                look back at your original Personal Narrative from the start of the course.
                How are you feeling now about the program and career path you chose back then? Have your plans
                changed-or become clearer?<br>
                You might reflect on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whether you're still planning to pursue the same program, or if you're considering a different one
                    based on what you've learned about Durham Tech credentials</li>
                <li>Any surprises from your Academic Timeline-like unexpected courses or credit requirements-and
                    whether that raised new questions</li>
                <li>What you discovered during your career research in the Occupational Outlook Handbook or Ferguson's
                    Career Guide</li>
                <li>Any new career ideas that caught your interest and how you plan to explore them</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="unindented">This is your chance to show how your thinking has evolved and what steps you want to
                take next.
            </p>

            <h1>Reflection:</h1>
            <p>In my original personal narrative, I stated that I was pursuing an Associate in Engineering, planning on
                transferring to NC State University and getting a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. So far,
                none of my plans have changed. I still intend on transferring and majoring in Computer Engineering;
                although, lately, I have been considering Purdue University (I really don't want to live in Indiana
                again, though).</p>
            <p>Additionally, I've been thinking about what I acutally want to do for a living. I realized I don't
                just want to work at NVIDIA designing graphics cards for the next 20 years; I want to work on developing
                all-in-one products (gamepads, laptops, etc.). I think Computer Engineering is the ideal major for this,
                so I'm sticking with it. And, if all else fails, my plan B is to drop out of my program, take CTS-3255A
                to prepare me for the A+ certification, and repair and maintain electronics.</p>
