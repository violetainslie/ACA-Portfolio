            <p>
                As a continuation of HW3 (Problem-Solution Paper), this update should should address the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which of your three possible “solutions” you tried</li>
                <li>An update as to how well your chosen ‘solution’ is working</li>
                <li>How you will either adapt the solution to work better in the future, OR, which different solution
                    you will try, as you continue to fix your “problem” in the future.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h1>Reflection:</h1>
            <p>The three possible solutions found for my procrasination were setting specific goals, creating a to-do
                list, and working in intervals with breaks in-between. I chose to create a to-do list. This solution has
                been very effective in me getting all of my work done; I do still struggle with forgetting about the
                various platforms my other assignments are on. In the future, I would add these assignments to my
                calendar, to give myself a notification. I can't always access these other sites (not very
                mobile-friendly), so being able to see the due dates in my calendar would be very beneficial! </p>
