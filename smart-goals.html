                This element of the Portfolio builds on our work in class around SMART Goals, Grit, and Mindset.
            <ul>
                <li>Your SMART Academic Goal Statement: Write a SMART goal that explains your academic goals, including
                    the credential you’re currently working toward at Durham Tech and any future degrees or
                    certifications
                    you plan to earn—even after you leave. Include when you hope to complete each step, the strategies
                    you'll use to stay on track, and any obstacles you might face along the way. Make sure your goal is
                    clear
                    and follows the SMART format: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound.</li>
                <li>Your SMART Professional Goal Statement: Write a SMART goal that specifically addresses your
                    professional goals, including any potential employers, future advancements, or career changes, as
                    well
                    as the
                    tentative timeline for when you intend to have achieved the goal(s). Include the specific plan
                    (strategies)
                    that you will use to execute your career goals, as well as your timeline for making it happen. Also
                    address
                    any potential obstacles or distractions that you may encounter along the way, and how you might push
                    through them. Be sure that your finished goal statement is Specific, Measurable, Attainable,
                    Realistic,
                    and
                    Time-bound.</li>
