            <p>
                Do some research to find out more about either a company/organization where you hope to become employed,
                or, about a college/university that you hope to transfer to after you leave Durham Tech. Regardless of
                whether
                you choose to do a Company Profile, or a University Profile, your completed document should be at least
                half of
                a page, typed and double-spaced. Depending on which option you choose, consider addressing some of the
                following bullet points in your narrative:
            <ul>
                <li>General overview of the college/university &#x2012; is
                    there a unique history or do they have a
                    particular focus or specialization?</li>
                <li>Admissions criteria &#x2012; What does a prospective
                    transfer student to this institution need to
                    have? (Average GPA of admitted students?
                    Certain courses? Certain experiences?)</li>
                <li>What is/are the admissions deadline(s)?</li>
                <li>How big is the student body/how many students
                    attend there? How large are classes, on average?</li>
                <li>How big is the campus, and where it is located?</li>
                <li>What is the average cost of tuition?</li>
                <li>Are there special scholarships or programs for transfer students?</li>
                <li>What challenges might a transfer student face
                    at that institution?
                </li>
            </ul>
